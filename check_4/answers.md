<: less than, comparison for if something is less than a certain specification. LIke you can't drive if you are less than 16 years old. Does not include the comparison number (in this case 16). Often useful if you are going right up to a value (like 15.999 will work but 16 won't.)

<=: less than or equal to. Most often if you want to go from a point downward including a the comparison number. So for example if you are less than or equal to 6 years old you can come inside.

\>: greater than. used to specify things that are greater than a value, like I want you to sell some of these apples if we have more than 10 in our house.

\>=: greater than or equal to. Often i think of this as going indefinitely up from a starting point, like you can drink if you are greater than or equal to 21.

=: equal to. equality comparison (like my wife is Sarah Mackey)

!=: not equal to. LIke my wife is not Jennifer Aniston.
