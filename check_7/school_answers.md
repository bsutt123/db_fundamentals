So I basically did this with my capstone, so I'm really comfortable with the classes students database.

so basically a `student` has a name and and id (in a basic database)
a `class` will have a name, and a capacity, and maybe a period or some way to check when the class happens

and then we have a join table that I called `class_students` which will be a reference to a student and a class. This will allow us to implement a many to many relationship of students -> classes.


Thats really all you need for a simple database. You can do a lot more, but I think that this iswhat we need for this implementation.
